Bishop Sacrifice
It is important to know when to sacrifice a bishop on h7 and when it is not.
Most players are always looking for crazy sacrifices that donâ€™t work and end up putting themselves down lots of material and not much else to show for their efforts.
When you want to sacrifice your bishop on h7 there are a few things that you need in place for it to work.
Need light square bishop on the b1-h7 diagonal
Need knight on f3
Need Queen that can jump to h5
Need bishop along the c1-h6 diagonal (usually seen on c1)
Need pawn on e5
Make sure that you have these things or this sacrifice is doomed from the beginning.

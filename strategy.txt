Bishop Sacrifice
It is important to know when to sacrifice a bishop on h7 and when it is not.
Most players are always looking for crazy sacrifices that don’t work and end up putting themselves down lots of material and not much else to show for their efforts.
When you want to sacrifice your bishop on h7 there are a few things that you need in place for it to work.
Need light square bishop on the b1-h7 diagonal
Need knight on f3
Need Queen that can jump to h5
Need bishop along the c1-h6 diagonal (usually seen on c1)
Need pawn on e5
Make sure that you have these things or this sacrifice is doomed from the beginning.

Chess games are usually either open or closed and it’s important to know the difference between the two. Open games are those games where the pawn structure is not locking up the middle and there is lots of wide open spaces for pieces to move. Closed games, like the image to the right, are those games where the pawns have a defined structure and blocking the mobility of different pieces.
Bishops tend to fair better in open games as their strength is using long diagonals. Knights tend to do better in closed games as they can move around to every square where a bishop can easily get blocked in and become useless. Always be mindful in every chess game if it is open or closed and act accordingly.

Useful Debugging Tools

Console.table()  —> Transfers dataset into an interactive table

Console.dir() —> Displays object as a JavaScript representation

Console.dirxml() —> Displays object in the language in which it is written

Console.time() and console.timeEnd() —> Displays how long a piece of code takes to execute

Watch Expressions —> Similar to console.log(), displays the value of any expression in the code without having to console.log() every variable

Use Breakpoints to pause the code at a point that you specify; useful for inspecting specific lines or areas of code
